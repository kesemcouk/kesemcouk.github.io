## The Sticking Point

My debut novel – a mix of speculative and literary fiction (or a speculative novel of ideas, to be exact). You can read the opening pages in [Bloom: UEA MA Prose Fiction Anthology 2020](https://www.eggboxpublishing.com/product-page/uea-ma-prose-fiction-anthology-2020), and the full story when it gets published… hopefully someday...

## Nameless (Attempt No. 489)

A dystopian short story I wrote that was published on [newwriting.net](https://www.newwriting.net/2020/11/nameless-attempt-no-489/).

## Hi. It’s Me. Your Friend, Remember?

A piece of flash fiction I wrote that was long listed for the 2021 Blinkpot Award. (Not sure if the e-book is still available for online viewing, though. It’s just a piece of flash fiction, so whatever.)

## Other Things I'm Working on

- A memoir of my trip

- A children’s fantasy book series

- A high school comedy film

- A suspense movie that takes place inside a movie theatre

- A speculative musical film

- An animated film

- A couple of pop albums
