I was born as one of a set of triplets in Israel, where I was the odd one out.

## Childhood
As a child, I dabbled in a lot of arts. 
I mailed the most famous children’s author in Israel books with fan-fiction that I wrote. 
I created a theatre show that I performed every year from kindergarten to middle school. 
I played the piano for six years. 
I was in the school choir, and opened the graduation show with a solo. 
I painted every week and created costumes. 

## Adolescence
Everything changed in middle school, when I was bullied and alone. Constant peer pressure and homophobia led to depression. I quit my hobbies, studied Japanese, and started to hide my thoughts and emotions. 
Coming out in high school to my close friends didn’t help. I focused on homework, and gave up on the idea of finding love. To my confusion, I also became bisexual. I started writing my first novel, inspired by my self-harm. 

#University
After ignoring everyone’s career advice, I graduated summa cum laude in a multidisciplinary degree course in Humanities and Arts from Tel-Aviv University. It completely changed the way I saw life. 
Then I graduated with merit from the UK’s most prestigious Creative Writing master’s program. Another experience that transformed me as a writer. 
I wanted to start a PhD and stay in the UK for good, but COVID and money ruined it. 

## Big Trip
I returned to Israel with my dream crushed. Nothing I tried bore fruit. I was stuck in an environment that didn’t accept me, and didn’t have anything to live for. 
When Japan reopened after two and a half years, I travelled there for three months. This somehow extended into fourteen months across East Asia. I documented each day of this trip on this website. 
My travel blog helped me open up and share my shy, private self with others. I literally came out of my shell by posting my childhood journals. 
I became a new person - confident, adventurous, extroverted. A mature evolution of my childhood self. At the same time, I experienced love again, and again, and again. A misfit robot had left Israel, and ended a sociable romantic in Asia.

## Present
Relocating to Tokyo was the next step for me. I recently attended a Japanese language school for a year. Nowadays, I navigate corporate slavery, while branching into music and comedy.
