<p>In chapter 1, I…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Share my hobbies and passions from seventh grade</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grapple with pressure from other students to come out at the age of fourteen</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="back-to-seventh-grade">Back to Seventh Grade</h2>

<p>Welcome to the first chapter of my coming out story. I hate calling it like that, because I never intentionally put myself in the closet, but I can’t come up with a better title.</p>

<p>I mean, I tried:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Trials and tribulations of a queer teenager</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growing up in the shadow of heteronormativity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait, when did I enter this closet?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kesem does teen angst</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stranger in a strange land</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diary of a 14-year-old who has nothing going on for him and is about to lose the potential to, but at least does well in school because he thinks good grades will help him achieve his dreams</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t read this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God, this turned grim</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fake it till you make it: my journey toward happiness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m okay. Kinda going through a rough patch, but it’ll pass. At least I hope so, because nothing in my life worked out the way I’d intended it to, and I’m surrounded by teenagers acting like actual teenagers, but I’m glad some people are happy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wasting my time on Earth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s normal people, and then there’s me</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People constantly assume I was born cishet and that I seek everything they do: a memoir</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seriously, I don’t remember choosing to live inside a closet and deal with the pressure of coming out, so, uh, no thanks</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>None of these are as crisp and informative as “Coming Out”. Besides, back then I used this term myself, so spurning it now would be anachronistic.</p>

<p>At first, I translated just the segments related to my sexuality, because many of my diary entries include things like friendship problems, my love for Nintendo, etc. But then I realised those things show who I was at the time, and can’t be separated from the issues I was facing.</p>

<p>This series of posts will include some childish shenanigans and immature sections. They’ll probably be annoying to read, but at least they don’t represent me anymore. I read them wondering who this person was.</p>

<p>I’d journalled <em>a lot</em> back then – sometimes on a daily basis – so I chose the best bits. They quickly formed 15 chapters almost on their own. My fourteenth birthday entry from <a href="https://kesem.co.uk/to-be-alive-part-1-%e7%94%9f%e3%81%8d%e3%81%a6%e3%81%84%e3%81%8f%e3%81%9f%e3%82%81%e3%81%ab%e3%80%81%e3%81%9d%e3%81%ae%ef%bc%91/">To Be Alive, Part 1</a> counted as the prologue.</p>

<p>The only things I redacted were either too private, or details surrounding other people.</p>

<p>Before I go into that, I figured some pictures from that period would be worth a few thousand words.</p>

<p>Here is a cardboard t-shirt we did in arts and crafts class that I decorated with my then-obsessions:</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/det9qfsir/image/upload/v1769361915/website_images/2023/01/IMG_1571-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The top right corner depicts the Dango family from an anime called Clannad. I developed an unhealthy fixation with those adorable creatures in seventh grade (2007).</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/det9qfsir/image/upload/v1769361808/website_images/2023/01/IMG_1572-1024x768.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I kept nearly every drawing or painting I’d produced in childhood, including a notebook full of Fakemon I had designed with a friend. I’d drawn the Dango family everywhere; too many relics act as proof. Eventually it became a running gag for my friends to draw them being tortured or killed. For example, from a girl in Japanese class:</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/det9qfsir/image/upload/v1769361727/website_images/2023/01/IMG_1574-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Hebrew on the left reads “sex drugs and jacket!” (No idea what the jacket is supposed to mean). And down, next to the squashed Dango: “mission accomplished!”</p>

<p>I wonder if there are any Dango pillows in Japan. It would be pretty kawaii.</p>

<p>In Israel, when students reach seventh grade, they are tasked with a paper about their genealogy. I can’t translate the term for this to English, but it’s a big project that explores who you are, who your family is, and where in the world you are from. I threw away mine, so here’s what my sister’s says about me:</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/det9qfsir/image/upload/v1769361775/website_images/2023/01/Chapter-1-picture-7-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Characteristics-</strong></p>

<p>Aspires for freedom and independence, open and tolerant to anything new (mostly food), different or unique, has an open power [??? No idea what this means] and is considered liberal in areas of life. Has the willpower to achieve extreme goals without accepting interference from the outside world; friendly, projects aloofness and coldness, lack of mercy and materialism, cerebral, honest, loyal and trustworthy, hates lies and deceit and wars; yearns for people to respect his individuality, sensitive, artistic and claustrophobic – mostly toward caves, short and narrow places and the underground.</p>

<p><strong>Hobbies-</strong></p>

<p>Sleeping, being on the computer, watching TV, reading and playing video games, watching anime and reading manga and studying Japanese.</p>

<p>(This description might’ve been copied from my paper. Next to the picture, it says “me and my sister”, not “me and my brother”.)</p>

<p>Finally, here’s my favourite song from that period. It was released on 12 February 2008. For months, I’d ask kids at school who recorded it on their cell phone to play it during recess; my siblings always carried the cell phone the three of us shared until tenth grade.</p>

<p>And now, chapter one, written two days after my fourteenth birthday.</p>

<p>Wednesday 18/02/09</p>

<p>Omg!</p>

<p>I’m so so excited, I’m hyperactive, my heart is still pounding since I saw the official announcement of the new Nintendo DS model, the DSi, in the US!</p>

<p>Turns out according to the rumours the date is correct and it will launch on April 5th in the US! […] All I have to do is talk to mom about permission and it’s settled – I’ll finally have a DS.</p>

<p>And even if this news isn’t exciting enough – I just got a call that the Wii game I ordered for my birthday from D, Animal Crossing: City Folk is here!!!</p>

<p>I’m so excited.</p>

<p>And about other things:</p>

<p>Everyone is really pressuring me about me being gay, and it’s very clear and all the time I’m being asked if I’m like that. Even Y, B’s cousin who studies with us in class asked me today (again) and told me he can out me. I’m avoiding but also replying no, but I feel really bad about it. They’re pressuring me to come out of the closet, and I don’t blame them because they’re still going through psychological processes in puberty but they:</p>

<p>Don’t know what I’m going through with my sexual identity and the feelings, confusion, thoughts I experience, so this pressure is another huge burden for me.</p>

<p>They also, according to what I’ve read, don’t understand what it means and of course what I’m going through so they definitely don’t understand how I feel.</p>

<p>I think it kind of makes sense for them to ask if I’m gay because I obviously act like one and it’s very clear. But god leave me alone and go solve your own problems! I’m sure you have.</p>

<p>I want to tell B but she con=stant=ly tells me to “come out or stop acting gay” and it’s very bothersome.</p>

<p>I’m once again confused about whether to tell her because now what I predict her reaction to be like is “Finally!” or something like that and I don’t want it to happen this way because then part of the coming out will have been out of the pressure she put on me.</p>

<p>On the other hand there’s always H, who has always been close to me and knows about me, without knowing herself, more than any other person. The problem is I think that even though she’ll react in a better way she’ll harass me about it and constantly ask questions and therefore bother me and not respect my privacy.</p>

<p>I guess I have a lot of “thinking” to do… :X</p>
