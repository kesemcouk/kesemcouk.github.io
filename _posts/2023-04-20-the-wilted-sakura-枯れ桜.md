National garden 
In the world’s biggest metropolitan 
Green and expansive 
Trees and flowers abound 
Konbini picnic at a Japanese garden 
Under a Sakura whose petals are on the ground 
Defeated and wilting 
Past its prime 
Drilling and noises of construction 
Airplanes flying by 
No escape from the city 
Make it stop for a short while 
 
A missed opportunity 
Months of search end in none 
What I’d give to return to that moment 
I would fix my mistake 
I wouldn’t feel the need to sob 
If you’re out there, I’m sorry 
I was afraid, and acted blind 
This sort of thing has never happened before 
Who knows if there'll be a second time.
