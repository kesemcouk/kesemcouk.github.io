A one-room hut  
Alone on a mountain  
Only two and a half walls  
To protect it from nature  
A small alcove  
A wooden shelf  
A low table  
No more than that

To live here in seclusion  
And write poems  
Practice Buddhism  
Watch cherries blossom  
A thousand-year-old relic  
Like I’m back in the past  
Vines and moss  
A simpler life

The only foreign visitor  
In a Japanese bunch  
Birds singing  
Picnics by the hut  
Serene by day  
What would it feel like at night?  
Probably scary enough  
To thank the sunrise

I can still watch it  
He is underground  
Someday I’ll join him  
Till then, I’ll cry.
