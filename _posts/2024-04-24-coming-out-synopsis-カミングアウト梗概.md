## Synopsis

Between 17-20 March 2023, I hiked for the first time: a four-day pilgrimage in Japan to grand shrines. This experience was so grueling and spiritual, that it made me reflect a lot about life.

Growing up in Israel different from everyone, I'd kept a lot of secrets. Now, through this blog in Japan, I finally felt welcomed enough to open up.

During the pilgrimage, I shared a diary entry from my fourteenth birthday. It explained the walls I'd built around myself, and included the first mention of my sexuality in my childhood diaries ("[To Be Alive, Part 1](https://kesem.co.uk/to-be-alive-part-1-%e7%94%9f%e3%81%8d%e3%81%a6%e3%81%84%e3%82%8b%e3%81%93%e3%81%a8%e7%ac%ac%e4%b8%80%e7%ab%a0/)").

On 28 March 2023, I started sharing all the diary entries that chronicled my sexual ups and downs. My wacky hobbies and passions from seventh grade; the way students had been pressuring me to come out ("[Chapter 1](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-1-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac1%e7%ab%a0/)"). In the absence of someone I could trust, I'd begun having nightmares about supernatural beings trying to break into my house and kill me, when I was home alone at night ("[Chapter 2](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-2-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac2%e7%ab%a0/)").

I tried to change my appearance while stressing over school and my ugliness ("[Chapter 3](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-3-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac3%e7%ab%a0/)"). Feeling misunderstood by my friends, I decided to come out in person to one ("[Chapter 4](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-4-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac4%e7%ab%a0/)"). But when it hit me that I finally had friends, I felt no need to add sexual fuel to my social fire ("[Chapter 5](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-5-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac5%e7%ab%a0/)").

When the friend I'd wanted to come out to said I would always be alone because I was gay, I realized I was too ugly and annoying for anyone to desire. I took pride in the walls I’d built around myself and focused on my dream of writing, yet found that I had lost the ability to cry ("[Chapter 6](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-6-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac6%e7%ab%a0/)").

With increasing nightmares, I resolved to come out before my fifteenth birthday. Despite my anger and pain, I forced myself to keep a straight face ("[Chapter 7](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-7-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac7%e7%ab%a0/)"). I grew addicted to my new Nintendo DSi, and realized gay people were everywhere ("[Chapter 8](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-8-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac8%e7%ab%a0/)").

Inspired by stories of Israeli teenagers with queer relationships, I began to work on my self-esteem ("[Chapter 9](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-9-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac9%e7%ab%a0/)"). Realizing how much I'd grown in one year, I dreaded the possibility that coming out would ruin my friendships ("[Chapter 10](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-10-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac10%e7%ab%a0/)"). I changed my appearance, partied with friends, and got bullied ("[Chapter 11](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-11-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac11%e7%ab%a0/)"). On my fifteenth birthday, I failed to come out ("[Chapter 12](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-12-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e7%ac%ac12%e7%ab%a0/)").

In high school, I grew obsessed with gore and sadism. I wrote, directed, edited, and starred in a music video of The Beatles’ Maxwell’s Silver Hammer ("[Chapter 13](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-13-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac13%e7%ab%a0/)"). As I turned sixteen, my interests darkened. Friendships dissolved; others formed. I realized coming out would never advance me, let alone to find a boyfriend. When I finally came out to a friend, I felt unfulfilled by this stressful confession ("[Chapter 14](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-14-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac14%e7%ab%a0/)").

Coming out to another friend didn't help. I fantasized about a same-sex relationship, yet struggled to imagine myself in one. Then, I developed an attraction to the opposite sex. Feeling abandoned, I grew sick of my fake friends and homophobia in Israel. I realized my emotional armor had led to depression, and dreamed of living more freely abroad in my twenties ("[Chapter 15](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-15-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac15%e7%ab%a0/)").

So I focused on studying, and gave up on the idea of intimacy. Constant homophobia and self-hatred pushed me to self-harm. I turned eighteen, and started working on my first novel. After graduating from high school, I began working at a bookshop, and came out as bisexual ("[Epilogue](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-epilogue-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e3%82%a8%e3%83%94%e3%83%ad%e3%83%bc%e3%82%b0/)").

At twenty-four, I moved to the UK, but failed to open up. Now, at twenty-eight, I fulfilled my dream, on my current trip in Japan. My temporary happiness made me realize I'd failed in life ("[Chapter 15](https://kesem.co.uk/coming-out-chapter-15-%e3%82%ab%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%a2%e3%82%a6%e3%83%88%e3%80%81%e7%ac%ac15%e7%ab%a0/)").
