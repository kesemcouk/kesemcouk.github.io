## 2-6 May 2023

Things I haven't documented yet include:

- My day alone in Asakusa, instantly one of the highlights of this trip

- An old capsule hotel, and an English lad with unexpected words of wisdom

- Growing weary of traveling

- My day in Kawasaki and Meguro, and a haunting encounter that pushed me deeper into Japan's dark side

- Returning to my host to participate in his bible class
