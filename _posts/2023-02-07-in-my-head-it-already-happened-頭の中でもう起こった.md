On nights like this, I am reminded of something I wrote when I was 19.

> ‘We spend our lives awaiting certain moments, counting the days, envisioning our reactions,’ Mary says. ‘Good or bad, when those moments arrive, we plead time to stop.’

I forgot what it feels like to jump for joy over a change in your life. The last time was three and a half years ago.

I probably shouldn’t advertise this, but this is one of the songs that represent me the most.
