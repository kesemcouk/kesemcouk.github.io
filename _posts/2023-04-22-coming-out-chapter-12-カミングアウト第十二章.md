The time- late, almost 23:00

(Watch lost around two weeks ago! I keep taking it off to ventilate my hand and haven’t found it since…)

Birthday!

Today I’m 15. Exciting huh? Actually not so much. Like last year- I’m past the excitement. I grew up!

Ever since S’s birthday (surprise party) on Friday, my stomach has been hurting nonstop. Even until today. So I started this birthday in the bathroom…

That’s okay though. School was fine, a normal day. Everyone wished me happy birthday and was really nice.

B-chan came over in the afternoon - like last year we wanted, with A too, but she’s sick… feel better Kapara Ale’a!

There was a “majors” night at school- I want physics and cinema at the moment- but I didn’t want to go, it was meh. \[redacted\] went, so me and B were supposed to be alone. I’ve been waiting for this opportunity for months, and I truly planned to come out today \[…\] because we would finally be alone, but at the last moment her mom asked her to come regardless so it didn’t work out… so I would’ve stayed alone… so I convinced N to come over (it was evening), and then we played New Super Mario Bros Wii which I got recently! We finished the game (sort of). It was really fun. Then I had to do some homework… then I watched the finale of House MD- and that was it. I’m a bit bummed that it didn’t work out with B-chan- but that’s okay. Anyway today was okay, I’m glad I “grew up a year” and I’m celebrating it on Friday! Everyone will come over in the evening, we’ll play Mario, watch a movie… on Saturday we’ll celebrate with grandpa and D at a restaurant. I’m tired as hell, but I’ll write by Saturday for sure.

Tomorrow Betty will (probably) be over… I’m almost certain the last 2 episodes will be broadcast. I’m sad the season’s over already, it went by too fast… but I can’t wait for the next one! Hopefully there’ll be good episodes.

It’s been so hectic; tests, homework, papers, projects, writing stories in English, pre-high school stress… I can barely keep up and play Mario all day long.

At least it’s fun…!

God he’s so hot.

\[…\]

I have to meet B…
