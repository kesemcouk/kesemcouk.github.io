In chapter 11, I...

The picture above is from 8 August 2009, when I threw a party at my place just like SpongeBob did in season 3.

The entries between last chapter's (May 2009) and the following (September 2009) include things like the announcement of _two_ new Mario games at Nintendo’s 2009 E3 and me feeling on cloud nine; cutting my hair into a Beatles-inspired bowl cut; my new bedroom getting a makeover; graduating from Japanese class; fantasising about having a boyfriend; throwing a “black-and-white ball” at my place (inspired by Ugly Betty season 2 episode 3) and feeling happy I had friends to invite; documenting my sleep problems; going to a new arts class and drawing something other than a Dango for once; and growing closer to A, who will become important later on.

Beeeettttyyyy is back!!!! Two episodes already, and it's so good, worth waiting a whole year for – it's tre ferosh \[LOL this was my Christian Siriano fanboy phase\] now I watch it all the time.

Today is Saturday but it's actually vacation, Kippur is Sunday Monday so anyhow we didn't study today at all – watched a pretty average movie about a murder without a motive by a pot-smoking teenager who decided to kill a passer-by. Long story short there were pretty horrifying pictures of the body, completely butchered... okay it's starting to give me nightmares...

Anyway not much is happening right now at school, back to normal, there was a math exam already (83, average...); a biology project (100 for the plant cell model with N) and that's basically it.

Meanwhile I (and N) got a new computer, which is in my room – yay!! I'm listening to the Beatles on the computer while finally writing. In the last few hours I fell into a very melancholic mood, and it pushed me to look at tips & coming out stories, which is really depressing of course. But I almost managed to cry – today was the only time I was this moved by this subject – it's about time (and I haven't cried for like 8 months I think even more).

The rest of this very long entry surrounds my new art class, boys I was attracted to, being called a “cheerleader” by some bullies, and missing my old Japanese class.
